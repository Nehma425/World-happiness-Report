Data Source: World Happiness Report 2021
Summary:
The data source for this project is the World Happiness Report 2021, a comprehensive and authoritative publication that assesses the subjective well-being of individuals across countries. The dataset includes various factors contributing to happiness, such as Ladder score, Standard error of ladder score, Logged GDP per capita, Social support, Healthy life expectancy, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Perceptions of corruption, and more. Each entry corresponds to a specific country, making it a rich resource for understanding global happiness trends.
Reasons for Choosing this Data Set:
Relevance: The World Happiness Report is a widely recognized and respected source for assessing and understanding global happiness. It provides a holistic view of well-being by considering multiple factors, making it suitable for a comprehensive analysis.
Geographical Component: The dataset inherently includes a geographical component through the "Country name" variable, which is crucial for conducting geospatial analysis, one of the project's requirements.
Temporal Relevance: The dataset is from the year 2021, meeting the project's requirement of being no more than three years old.
Rich Feature Set: The dataset includes both continuous and categorical variables, offering a diverse range of information for analysis. This variety is essential for exploring relationships and patterns in the data.
Open Accessibility: The World Happiness Report is open-source and publicly available, making it accessible for research purposes. This aligns with the project's requirement for an open-source data set.
Professional Interest: The project aims to explore factors influencing happiness globally, and the World Happiness Report dataset is well-suited for this purpose due to its focus on subjective well-being and the multitude of contributing factors.
